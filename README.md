# Habitat for Humanity UT Campus Chapter Point Log Update Automation: Project Overview
*   Created a tool that automates the update of the UT Habitat for Humanity Points Log
*   Manipulated the datasets to translate better between the two
*  Iterated through the GM sign in dataset and automatically updated the Points Log dataset when First and Last names matched

# Collection and Cleaning
*   Collected data from UT Habitat for Humanity's previous year's database
*   Lowered and stripped every Last Name, First Name, and Email address and passed through null dividers
